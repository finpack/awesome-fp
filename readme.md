## Testimonials

Section for people sharing their experience after embracing Functional Programming in their projects. Particularly interesting are projects in the domain of FinPack / Morizon Finanse (finance and real estate).
The main point is that the scope of these resoucrces are *projects* rather than *building blocks*.
